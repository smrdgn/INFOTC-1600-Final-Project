# How to run Windows on your Mac device using Boot Camp Assistant
[Return to Homepage](README.md)

## Before you begin please ensure a couple things:
- Please ensure that you back up any data that you do not wish to risk losing. While data loss is unlikely to occur, it is still always a possibility. 
- Refer to [this support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468) and make sure you have a compatible device.
- Use that [same support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468) to help you figure out whether or not your device will require an external USB flash drive for installation. If your Mac runs OS X El Capitan or later, then you will not requre an external USB flash drive. 
- Find and install a full 64-bit version of the Windows operating system that you want to run. This file will need to be in a disk image format (ISO). Make sure you have the product key, if necessary. 
- Make sure you have at least 64GB of free space. However, it is recommended that you have at least 128GB to ensure the best experience. 
- Check the Secure Boot setting of your device and ensure that it is set to "Full Security", which is the default setting. If you have changed this setting, then make sure you change it back by following along [here.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208198)
- Lastly, ensure that your device operating system is completely up to date. This can be done by going to "System Preferences > Software Update" and installing the latest version of macOS. 


# Step 1: Open Boot Camp Assistant
For the first step of this tutorial, open the Boot Camp Assistant application. This is found by going to "Finder > Applications > Utilities > Boot Camp Assistant". Read the Introduction message that is shown, then click "Continue". 

# Step 2: Partition Your Drive
For the second step, you will select the Windows ISO image that you have installed by clicking the "Choose..." button and navigating to the ISO file and clicking "Open". After that, you will click and drag the Windows icon until it displays the correct amount of storage you would like to give it. Remember that at least 128GB is recommended for the best experience, but even more may be required depending on your needs. Once finished, ensure your device is connected to power and click "Install". It may ask for admin credentials, so input those and click "OK".

# Step 3: Windows Installation
Once the Boot Camp Assistant installation is finished, you will now be able to run Windows on your device. In order to do this, restart your device and hold down the "option" key. Doing so will prompt you to select which operating system you would like to run. Click "Windows" and it will then walk you through the installation process, which is just like any other Windows PC.

I hope this tutorial helped! If you are having any difficulty with this tutorial, please refer to [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208198).
