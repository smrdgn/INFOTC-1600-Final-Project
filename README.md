# How to run Windows on your Mac using Bootcamp

## Seth Rands

### Have you ever wanted or needed to use Windows for a particular purpose but couldn't because you have a Mac? Well, installing and using Windows on a Mac computer is a relatively easy process through the use of Boot Camp Assistant. This built in application comes with most Intel-based Macintosh computers and allows the computer to store and run both Windows and macOS operating systems. Please note, this process will not work on Macs with the M1 or M2 chip. processors. Please refer to this [Apple Support Page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468) to see if your computer is compatible with Boot Camp.
